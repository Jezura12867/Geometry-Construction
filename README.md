Purpose of program in desc.

If you want to use this program:

-Use the same syntax, that you'd use in geometry (e. g.:

1) AB; |AB| = 5 cm
2) k; k(A; 5 cm)

  END

)

-Enter in code (will add prompt, for now, you don't have to wait)
-Do not seperate lines with Ctr+Enter, simply use Enter
-When you are finished, type "END"

Okay Byee!
